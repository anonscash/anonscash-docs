# FAQ

anons.cash is a non-custodial Solana transfer interface that provides clean
wallet separation and private withdrawals using zero-knowledge proofs.

This FAQ covers technical and integration-focused questions.

---

## What problem does anons.cash solve?

Solana transfers are fully transparent. Funding wallets and receiving wallets
are linked by default. anons.cash breaks this link by introducing a withdrawal
step verified through a zero-knowledge proof.

Deposits and withdrawals remain public, but they cannot be connected to the
same user.

---

## Are funds ever held by anons.cash?

No. The system is non-custodial.

Users sign their own transactions. All movement of funds happens through
on-chain programs, not through a central party. There are no accounts, login
systems, or internal balances maintained by the interface.

---

## How does the deposit work?

A deposit is a standard Solana transaction into the pool program using a fixed
denomination. The deposit creates a claim that can later be withdrawn with a
valid proof.

The deposit does not reveal which wallet will perform the withdrawal.

---

## How does the withdrawal work?

A withdrawal includes:

1. a zero-knowledge proof generated by the user  
2. a withdrawal transaction submitted to the program  

The on-chain program verifies the proof and releases funds to the specified
wallet if the claim is valid and unused.

No direct link is revealed between the deposit wallet and the withdrawal
wallet.

---

## What does the zero-knowledge proof confirm?

The proof confirms:

• the user has a valid deposit  
• the deposit has not already been used  
• the withdrawal matches the correct denomination  

It does not reveal the deposit address or any identifying information.

---

## Can deposits or withdrawals be linked?

Not through normal on-chain analysis.

Observers can see deposits entering the pool and withdrawals leaving it, but
there is no information indicating which deposit belongs to which withdrawal.

---

## Does anons.cash support variable withdrawal amounts?

No. The system uses fixed denominations. This keeps the proof structure
predictable and avoids size-based linking.

---

## Does anons.cash run off-chain logic?

No. Verification is handled entirely by on-chain programs.

The interface does not maintain off-chain balances, routing logic, or private
ledgers.

---

## Can the operator block withdrawals?

No. Withdrawals are enforced by the on-chain program. If the proof is valid and
unused, the withdrawal succeeds. Operator discretion is not part of the
design.

---

## Does the system store any user data?

No. There are no accounts, sign-ins, user identifiers, or metadata logs.

anons.cash does not track user behavior or store off-chain activity.

---

## How are integrations expected to interact?

Integrators interact with:

• the deposit instruction  
• the withdrawal instruction  
• the local proof generation flow  

No additional state management or user accounts are required.

---

## Can services embed anons.cash for private funding?

Yes. Bots and applications can use the deposit and withdrawal steps to create
clean separation between public-facing wallets and internal operational
wallets.

---

## Are cross-chain flows involved?

No. anons.cash operates fully on Solana.

---

## Summary

The FAQ summarizes how anons.cash provides private, unlinkable transfers using
on-chain verification and zero-knowledge proofs while remaining fully
non-custodial and minimal in scope.
